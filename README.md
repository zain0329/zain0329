### Hi there 👋
My name is Zain Malik and I am an undergraduate student at the University of North Florida 🎓, majoring in Information Science with a minor in International Business 🌍. As an Honors Student in the Hicks Honors College, I have consistently achieved academic excellence 📚 and was accepted into the Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) International Honor Society as well as the CCEC High Flyers leadership program.

At the UNF ITS Help Desk 💻, I provided IT support, contributed to the knowledge base, and trained new hires. As a Web Development Intern at Elyk Innovation, I completed projects using HTML, CSS, WordPress, and SEO tools 🌐. My exchange semester at Sophia University in Tokyo enhanced my global perspective through courses in Marketing, Japanese History 🇯🇵, and language, as well as extracurricular activities.

I later interned in Materials Informatics at the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan 🇯🇵, deepening my technical skills and cultural adaptability. I actively participated in Osprey Robotics 🤖, traveling to the Lunabotics Competition and managing club media. In the Muslim Student Association, I organized events and created awareness through social media 📱.

Upon graduation 🎉, I aim to utilize these experiences to pursue a graduate degree in Information Science and build an international career in Informatics 🌐.
