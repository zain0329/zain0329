### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Zain Malik and I am an undergraduate student at the University of North Florida, majoring in Information Science with a minor in International Business. As an Honors Student in the Hicks Honors College, I have consistently achieved academic excellence and was accepted into the Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) International Honor Society as well as the CCEC High Flyers leadership program. At the UNF ITS Help Desk, I provided IT support, contributed to the knowledge base, and trained new hires. As a Web Development Intern at Elyk Innovation, I completed projects using HTML, CSS, WordPress, and SEO tools. My exchange semester at Sophia University in Tokyo enhanced my global perspective through courses in Marketing, Japanese History, and language, as well as extracurricular activities. I later interned in Materials Informatics at the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan, deepening my technical skills and cultural adaptability. I actively participated in Osprey Robotics, traveling to the Lunabotics Competition and managing club media. In the Muslim Student Association, I organized events and created awareness through social media. Upon graduation, I aim to utilize these experiences to pursue a graduate degree in Information Science and build an international career in Informatics.
