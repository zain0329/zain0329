### Hi there 👋
I am a current student at the University of North Florida, pursuing a major in Information Science with a minor in International Business. I am also an Honors Student in the Hicks Honors College at UNF. Additionally, I work at the Information Technology Services Help Desk at the university, where I provide first-level IT support for UNF staff and students, resolving hardware, software, network, and application issues. I have also served as a Web Development Intern at Elyk Innovation. During my academic journey, I completed an Exchange Semester at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan for my International Business minor. In my spare time, I am involved in extracurricular activities such as Osprey Robotics and the Muslim Student Association.
