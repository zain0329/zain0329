### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Zain Malik and I am a dedicated undergraduate student at the University of North Florida, pursuing a major in Information Science with a minor in International Business. As an Honors Student in the Hicks Honors College at UNF, I excel in my academic pursuits. I also bring my expertise to the Information Technology Services Help Desk on campus, where I provide essential support for the IT needs of UNF Staff and Students, resolving hardware, software, network, and application issues with precision and efficiency.

My professional experience also extends to a previous role as a Web Development Intern at Elyk Innovation. Enriched by an Exchange Semester at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan, as part of my International Business minor, I have broadened my global perspective. I aspire to leverage this valuable experience towards achieving my ambition of becoming a Systems Analyst in an International Organization.

Beyond academics and work, I actively participate in extracurricular activities such as Osprey Robotics and the Muslim Student Association, showcasing my well-rounded approach to personal and professional development.
